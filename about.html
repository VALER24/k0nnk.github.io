                    <strong>About Me</strong></h3>
                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5">Hello from K0NNK. I'm going to take you along my amateur radio journey.<div><br></div><div>It all started when I was 6 years old; My dad took me to a LPFM FM Broadcast Radio Station in Sugar Land, TX. You see, my dad was always wanted and was interested in FM radio broadcast stations and had a big passion for all kinds of Christian music.</div><div><br></div><div>Ever since that day for some reason it clicked in my brain and at 6 years old I wanted a radio station, a big dream for a 6 year old but did come true in time... Fast forward about 2 years and I heard about ham radio and amateur radio. I was browsing the internet on my families laptop and heard about ham radio and amateur radio. I did have a bit of confusion in my head about the two and here's what I thought. I thought that amateur radio was commercial and ham radio was non-profit. What I mean by that is this, you see FM and AM radio station play music and some of them play commercials and some are non-profit also called non-profit.</div><div><br></div><div>I saw that I needed a license for a amateur radio license (just like FM and AM radio stations) so I found a online free ham radio study guide (not hamstudy.org but similar) and started studying. I was a little confused on what everything in their they were saying. I got confused and pushed it to the side.</div><div><br></div><div>Fast Forward to when I was 10 years old. We moved up from Houston, Texas to Elkader, Iowa. It was a big change but we have been in Iowa two times before to visit my grandmother that lived in Elkader. Back to the story. So, we made friends with a family that lived right next door to my grandmothers house (we lived 1 block from my grandmothers house) the parent of his son Josh (that we made friends with) named John had some conversations with me. John and I started talking about radio. This refreshed my brain to the time I heard about ham radio. I was fascinated by what he said and was researching a lot about ham radio. When I was getting close to 11 years old I asked and told my parents what I wanted for Christmas (which was ham radio) I explained a little bit about it but I was to young and they didn't understand a lot about ham radio so they said no. I never left or forgot about ham radio; I started watching tons of videos of ham radio on YouTube and I was getting tons of experience (about the same as a new technician).</div><div><br></div><div>When I was turned 11 I told my Dad again about ham radio and showed him ham radio prep. I don't know if he forgot about the conversation a few months back or what but he said yes to me buying ham radio prep with my money. I started studying for my ham license and on my birthday (Feb 20th 2021) I got a Baofeng BF-F8HP radio. Now, I didn't have a license and I was just playing around with the radio. I tried to listen to ham freqs but never got anything. Later on, I found out that there were no repeaters in our area and NO VHF/UHF traffic for the ham bands.</div><div><br></div><div>About a month after my birthday I was going to go to Dubuque, Iowa to try to pass my technician which we canceled that plan cause a couple days before their was a big snow storm and the roads were still a mess.</div><div><br></div><div>In early summer I was going to go there again to try to pass my technician test but the computer broke down so I couldn't refresh my memory with the stuff I studied so that never happened.</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, in Late summer On August 7th 2021 at 11 years old I passed my technician at the Cedar Valley Hamfest in Central City, IA. I passed my license and then went and bought some radios at the hamfest! On August 9th 2021 the FCC gave me a callsign of KF0GJI! I later applied for a vanity of N0DYG.</div><div><br></div><div>Honestly I think I'm glad that I passed the tech 6 months after I would of. The reason being is the hamfest, experience that I have grown and finding info of ham radio stuff in my area and knowing what to expect.</div><div><br></div><div>At the time my callsign was in progress to change (takes 20 ish days) an amateur radio operator moved right next door to me (Mike AC0LJ). He was a extra and had a lot of experience. Almost every Saturday we would go and listen to HF traffic on his Icom HF radio in his shack. While he was moving in 2 of his friends (Alvin KC9MCC and someone else) helped him move in one time. I later became friends with Alvin KC9MCC who I talk to sometimes on the repeater across the great Mississippi River in Wisconsin.</div><div><br></div><div>Around the same time I made my first QSO with William WT0V in late August on the W0II repeater in Manchester, Iowa.</div><div>Fast Forward to October 2021 I won the Anytone 878 UVII Plus from BridgeCom Systems, which is a big story in its own. So with the Anytone whenever I would travel to Waterloo or Cedar Rapids Iowa I would make contacts on BM TG 3119 (Iowa Statewide) and sometimes listen on WW 91.</div><div><br></div><div>Now on December 25th 2021 for Christmas I got a AURSINC MMDVM Hotspot (just like the Jumbospot) and I got it working around 8 PM on Christmas day. All the time on January and the last few days of December I made contacts all day on WW 91 (DMR) with my Anytone radio. Now I could talk to people around the world at my house.</div><div><br></div><div>Now in early January I wanted to form a DMR youth net (after me finding a few youth that I talked to on WW 91) this was called the Digital Youth Net and we met 6:45 PM every Saturday starting on the third Saturday of January. Later we formed a net for Friday and Sunday. I was the "head" of this small net and we were almost like a group. So in early February we started a youth group. We called it the "Digital Youth Net Group" we sent out emails every week and sometimes did giveaways.</div><div><br></div><div>Right after we did that I found Discord. Thank JJ K0NH for inviting me to his youth group (in Central Iowa) which had a Discord server. After that I decided to copy what JJ K0NH did. I made a Discord server for the Digital Youth Net Group. In late February JJ K0NH pushed us to get a ham radio license for the group. So in late February we changed the name of our group the Digital Youth Net Group to Digital Youth Group and got a callsign from the FCC as KF0IAG. We applied a vanity (N0DYG) the same day.</div><div><br></div><div>At that time I decided to go and study for my general class license. On March 28th 2022 I passed my general license using a online program, and started to make QSOs on HF.</div><div><br></div><div>Fast forward to July 2022, I started to get into a lot of tech stuff and VOIP stuff. I got a Hams Over IP extension and Hamshack Hotline extension so I could call people and listen to various Allstar nodes on HH and HOIP. In August I got a Allstar node (57686) and started having fun and playing around with it. I linked Echolink and HOIP to it and formed a small linking system / Allstar hub call "KAS" or "K0NNK Allstar System."</div><div><br></div><div>So, today, I am a active amateur radio operator and big tech person. I own a server that runs various things including this website and my Allstar System. I'm active on my clubs DYG Discord Server and doing lots of tech things.</div><div><br></div><div>Whatever you do in your live wither it be young, or old; push forward and keep living that dream and make it a realty, I did at 11 years old, so can't you?</div><div><br><div><br></div></div></h4>
